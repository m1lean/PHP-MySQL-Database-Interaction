# Basic PHP-MySQL Database Interaction

This PHP script demonstrates fundamental interactions with a MySQL database, including database connection, table creation, data insertion, and retrieval.



## Installation

**To run the code:**

Ensure you have a local or remote MySQL server accessible.
Update the ```$servername```, ```$username```, ```$password```, and ```$dbname``` variables with your MySQL server details.


Run the script in a PHP environment (e.g., local server, hosting service) to execute the database operations.
Check the output for success messages or error notifications.

___Note: Make sure to have the MySQLi extension enabled in your PHP configuration.___
